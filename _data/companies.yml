    <q>City Girl Café started in 1997 with these two lovely people. We had never
    worked for better bosses and they taught us to be the bosses that we are. As
    we end our mutual 23 year stretch we want to give all the love to our
    mentors Merry and Cheryl.</q>

    <q>Winter was tough. This is the time of year when our sales double because
    of the patio. We’re missing out on that, and it carries the whole year, so
    there’s no way we can reopen…</q>

    <q>Watching a horror movie is more soothing than having to announce that
    Cuchi Cuchi will no longer exist... the fundamental purpose of socializing
    [with] food/wine/good company has been obliterated overnight by an unlucky
    fluke of nature which gives new meaning to ‘survival of the fittest.’ On the
    bright side, perhaps humans will now be more nurturing towards each other
    and the planet and less prone to feeling unabashedly special/invincible</q>

    <q>Cambridge has lost one of its coveted outdoor patios with the closure of
    Restaurant Dante within the Royal Sonesta Boston hotel. Owners and brothers
    Dante, Damian, and Filippo de Magistris announced Saturday that the Italian
    restaurant with scenic views of the Charles River is closing after 15 years.
