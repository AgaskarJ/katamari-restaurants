    <q>City Girl Café started in 1997 with these two lovely people. We had never
    worked for better bosses and they taught us to be the bosses that we are. As
    we end our mutual 23 year stretch we want to give all the love to our
    mentors Merry and Cheryl.</q>

    <q>Established in 1999, Toraya has been open for just over 20 years.
    Unfortunately, our restaurant is now closed for business. We would like
    our customers, vendors, and employees to know that we greatly appreciate
    all of you. Thank you for your generous support throughout the years.</q>
    Note: While not technically in Cambridge or Somerville, Toraya is an honorary
    guest due to its mastery of the field of Sushi and hospitality.

    <q>Winter was tough. This is the time of year when our sales double because
    of the patio. We’re missing out on that, and it carries the whole year, so
    there’s no way we can reopen…</q>

    <q>Watching a horror movie is more soothing than having to announce that
    Cuchi Cuchi will no longer exist... the fundamental purpose of socializing
    [with] food/wine/good company has been obliterated overnight by an unlucky
    fluke of nature which gives new meaning to ‘survival of the fittest.’ On the
    bright side, perhaps humans will now be more nurturing towards each other
    and the planet and less prone to feeling unabashedly special/invincible</q>

    <q>Cambridge has lost one of its coveted outdoor patios with the closure of
    Restaurant Dante within the Royal Sonesta Boston hotel. Owners and brothers
    Dante, Damian, and Filippo de Magistris announced Saturday that the Italian
    restaurant with scenic views of the Charles River is closing after 15 years.

    <q>We are beyond proud to have been a part of ES for nearly its entire
    duration, and heartbroken at the thought that a short-sighted landlord would
    rather end this Boston institution than work with an owner as passionate and
    dedicated to his community, his team and his guests during this
    unprecedented time in history. Sending so much love to the entire Eastern
    Standard Kitchen & Drinks family, past and present.</q>

    supporting us, celebrating your milestones with us, for all the hugs, and
    the memories, and family that formed here. we’re closing the Deep Ellum
    chapter on June 7th. but, we will be expanding our sister @lonestarallston
    into the current Deep Ellum space, and we can wait to show off our face lift
    when we are able to re-open. thanks for everything, we truly couldn’t have
    done this without you.</q>
    Another honorary Boston member. This place brought us many fond memories.
